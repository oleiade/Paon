Paon -- A simple Snake game written in C++, including a two players "Tron mode"

In order to compile it, you need g++-4.5 (Yes, you're gonna have to compile it
from source if you're on OSX). Just go in QTPaon-build-desktop and type 'make'
then on root directory type make too.

You're done, you can now load the game with the following command:

./exec/Paon x_plate_size y_plate_size lib_paon_qt.so

replacing x_plate_size and y_plate_size by a value beetween ]20;200]
